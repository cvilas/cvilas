### Vilas Chitrakaran, PhD, CEng 
Pricipal Roboticist | Consultant | Mentor

I lead teams working on the edge of chaos, ambiguity and possibility.

In over two decades of working in industrial robotics, I have delivered high-value state-of-the-art autonomous systems across manufacturing, nuclear, aerospace, defense and consumer electronics sectors.

Whether you're a frugal two-person tech startup or an established business exploring new frontiers, I may have something to offer. Please get in touch for engineering design consultation, contract development and mentoring.
